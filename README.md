Sashimi is a user-friendly software for efficient control of digital scanned light sheet microscopes (DSLMs).
It is developed by members of the [PortuguesLab](http://www.portugueslab.com/)
 at the Technical University of Munich and Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology. Sashimi relies on the fast, multidimensional
 [Napari viewer](https://github.com/napari/napari).
 
While built for a particular microscope configuration, the modular architecture allows for easy replacement of
hardware by other vendors (we will help with and welcome contributions for supporting other cameras, boards and light sources).
 

 
## Installation

[Install the latest Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution of Python 3.

Clone this repository and navigate to the main folder `../sashimi`

### Recommended: Create a new environment

It is a good practice to create an environment for every project. The provided `environment.yml` sets up almost all required dependencies (see below).

    conda env create -f {path to environment.yml}

You can activate the environment by running:

    conda activate sashimi
    
After this you have to install two extra dependencies: `pyvisa` and our forked version of `napari`:

    pip install pyvisa
    pip install git+https://github.com/portugueslab/napari.git#egg=napari
    
### Install with pip

For a non-editable installation run:

    pip install .

Otherwise, if you want to contribute to the project as a developer, for editable installation run:

    pip install -e .

Now you are ready to go!

## Configuring sashimi
    
Running `sashimi --debug` lets you start the software without any hardware connected to the machine. Sashimi includes the
`sashimi-config` module that lets you interact with the hardware and software settings from command line. You can display the
 current configuration of the system. **You must run this command before launching sashimi for the first time**:
 
    sashimi-config show
    
You can ask sashimi for help:
   
    sashimi --help
 
More information on its usage can be found by asking `sashimi-config` for help:

    sashimi-config --help
   
You can add and modify parameters just from the command line. For example, to set the piezo waveform readout channel to `Dev1/ao0:0` just run:

    sashimi-config edit -n z_board.write.channel -v Dev1/ao0:0
    
Or to modify the minimum and maximum voltage (in Volts) of the channel:
    
    sashimi-config edit -n piezo.position_write.min_val -v 0
    sashimi-config edit -n piezo.position_write.max_val -v 10
    

## Starting the software from command line

Open a new anaconda prompt and activate your environment like above. Then run:

    sashimi
    
Add the option `--scopeless`:

    sashimi --scopeless
    
If you want to run the software with mock hardware, such as for debugging or developing.
